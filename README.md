## Summary
The data from New York indicates that more men are taking advantage of the bike sharing than women.  This could be due to multiple societal factors that could be investigated further.  Typically childcare and elder care roles fall to women, and most bikes would not accomodate multiple family members at once.

Most bike rides for men and women are short during the peak hours, before and after a 9-5 workday, indicating persons work close to home.  It would be worthwhile to do further research on how far a typical commute to work is for a typical person in Des Moines.
